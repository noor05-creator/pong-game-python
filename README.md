## 🏓 Pong Game (Python Turtle Edition)

A simple implementation of the classic Pong Game built using Python’s turtle graphics library.
This project is a beginner-friendly way to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python while building a fun arcade-style game.

## 🚀 Features

Two-player gameplay (left paddle vs right paddle).

Paddle movement controls (Up/Down keys).

Score tracking using a Scoreboard.

Clean, modular code with separate files for Paddle and Scoreboard classes.

Built entirely with Python’s built-in turtle module (no external dependencies).
